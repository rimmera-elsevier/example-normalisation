				Good practise to put a set of paragraphs (1 in this case) in a section.
				Assuming that the members of the set belonging to the section can be derived from the source document.
				In documents with multiple paragraphs and multiple pages/columns the section-borders may not always be trivial to derive from source document
				If sections can not be derived from the source document in a first pass, then sections may be found (at a later moment) and expressed in the JSON, making use of whatever was derived from the source document

				Elements in the body receive a identifier that is unique in the document
